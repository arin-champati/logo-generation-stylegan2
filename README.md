# StyleGan2 Logo Generation Tool
Welcome to our Spring 2021 Junior Paper for Princeton University!

There are many difficulties associated with logo design, including client to designer communication, creative roadblocks, and plagarism / copyright laws. To solve some of these problems, we created a tool that allows users to generate and control features of logos that do not exist.

We used StyleGAN2 to train on two different datasets - one of logos with text and one of logos without text. We then interpreted the latent space of each model through supervised and unsupervised methods and implemented other helpful features, such as projection of existing logos (using with a novel loss function).
